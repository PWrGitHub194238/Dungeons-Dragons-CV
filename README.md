# Dungeons-Dragons-CV

My interactive CV project heavily based on [Dungeons & Dragons RPG](http://dnd.wizards.com/) and [Heroes of Might and Magic III](https://www.ubisoft.com/pl-pl/game/heroes-of-might-and-magic-3-hd/) (sorry, [New World Computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_World_Computing), You had no site for it :/) graphic style. This is an extended version of my [regular CV](https://github.com/PWrGitHub194238/Dungeons-Dragons-CV/blob/master/Documents/CV_2018.pdf) (which was writen in a is bit more formal style), including some psychological tests' results such as [Standout Assessment](https://standout.tmbc.com/) or [16 Personalities](https://www.16personalities.com/) test etc.
